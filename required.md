Support filter level adjustment (1-10)
Frame processor optimization:
Implement efficient GPU-based processing with GPUImage
Support high frame rates with minimal latency
Create pipeline for multiple filter composition
Performance monitoring:
Track frame rate and processing time

Automatically adjust quality based on device capabilities

# Project Architecture (MVVM):

1. Data Layer:

- Models (/models):
  - CameraSettings: Wrapper for AdvancedCameraSettings with validation
  - CameraConfiguration: Native camera configuration
  - Data transfer objects for camera states and settings

2. Domain Layer:

- Repository (/repository):
  - CameraRepository: Interface defining camera operations
  - CameraRepositoryImpl: Implementation using CameraX
  - Handles camera lifecycle and operations
  - Manages camera states and configurations

3. Presentation Layer:

- ViewModel (/viewmodels):
  - CameraViewModel: Manages camera business logic
  - Handles UI events and updates
  - Maintains camera state using StateFlow
  - Coordinates between UI and Repository

4. UI Layer (/ui):

- CameraPreview: Surface for camera preview
- FilterUI: Filter selection and adjustment UI
- Camera controls and settings UI

5. Dependency Injection (/di):

- Module definitions for ViewModels
- Repository and Service providers
- Singleton management

6. Core Components:

- BeautyCameraPlugin.kt: Plugin registration and initialization
- CameraManager.kt: Core camera functionality
- BeautyCameraPluginPigeon.kt: Generated Pigeon API implementation

7. Features:

- Filters (/filters):
  - GPUImage integration for real-time filtering
  - Face detection processing
  - Custom beauty filter implementations
- Utils (/utils):
  - Common utilities and extensions
  - Performance monitoring tools
  - Error handling utilities

Data Flow:

1. UI Events -> ViewModel
2. ViewModel -> Repository
3. Repository -> Camera/Filter Operations
4. Results -> ViewModel (StateFlow)
5. UI Updates <- ViewModel

Key Architecture Principles:

- Single Responsibility: Each component has a specific role
- Dependency Inversion: High-level modules independent of low-level ones
- Interface Segregation: Clean API boundaries between layers
- Reactive Updates: StateFlow for UI state management
- Clean Architecture: Clear separation of concerns
- Testability: Each layer can be tested independently

Implementation Guidelines:

1. Use Kotlin Coroutines for asynchronous operations
2. Implement proper error handling across layers
3. Follow SOLID principles strictly
4. Maintain clean separation between layers
5. Use dependency injection for better testability
6. Implement comprehensive logging and monitoring
7. Optimize performance at each layer
8. Handle configuration changes properly
9. Implement proper cleanup in onDestroy
10. Follow Android lifecycle best practices
